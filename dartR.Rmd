# dartR Genotyping Data Analysis Module
  
## What is dartR?
  
**dartR** (Data Analysis and Reporting Tools for R) is an R package specifically designed for analyzing**DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology)** genotyping data. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for processing, quality control, filtering, and analyzing reduced-representation sequencing data like DArTseq markers.

### Key Features:
- **Data Import**: Import DArT data in various formats including CSV, Excel, and DArT-specific formats
- **Quality Control**: Filter markers based on call rate, reproducibility, and other quality metrics
- **Population Genetics**: Calculate genetic diversity statistics, population structure, and genetic distances
- **Visualization**: Create various plots for data exploration and quality assessment

## Common Procedures in dartR Analysis

### 1. **Data Import and Conversion**


## Common Terminology
- **Genlight Object:** The core data structure in dartR that stores:
  
- **Genotype Matrix:**  Binary (0/1/2) or presence/absence data

- **Locus Metadata:** Information about each marker (chromosome, position, etc.)

- **Individual Metadata:** Sample information (population, location, etc.)

- **Quality Metrics:**Quality Metrics: Call rate, reproducibility, etc.

## Key Metrics:
  - **Call Rate:** Percentage of samples successfully genotyped for a marker

  - **Reproducibility:** Consistency of marker calls across technical replicates

  - **Minor Allele Frequency (MAF):** Frequency of the less common allele

  - **Polymorphic Information Content (PIC):** Measure of marker informativeness

  - **Observed Heterozygosity:** Proportion of heterozygous individuals

## Filtering Thresholds:
  - **Call Rate:** Typically >0.90-0.95 Keep markers with ≥90-95% success rate

  - **Reproducibility:** Typically >0.98-0.99 High confidence markers

  - **MAF: Typically** 0.01-0.05 Remove rare alleles

## Uses and Applications
### 1. Genetic Diversity Studies 
  - **Estimate genetic diversity within and between populations**

  - **Calculate F-statistics (Fst, Fis, Fit)**

  - **Assess population differentiation**

### 2. Population Structure Analysis
- **Identify genetic clusters using PCA, DAPC, or STRUCTURE-like analyses**

- **Detect admixture and hybridization**

- **Assign individuals to populations**

### 3. Association Studies
- **Prepare genotype data for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**

- **Calculate kinship matrices for mixed models**

### 4. Conservation Genetics
- **Assess genetic variation in endangered species**

- **Monitor genetic erosion**

- **Guide breeding programs**

### Importance in Genetic Analysis
#### Why Use dartR?
- **Specialized for DArT Data:** Optimized for DArT is specific data format and characteristics

- **Comprehensive Pipeline:** All-in-one solution from raw data to publication-ready results

- **Quality Assurance:** Rigorous quality control to ensure reliable results

- **Reproducibility:** Script-based analysis ensures transparent and repeatable research

- **Integration:** Easily integrates with other R packages for downstream analyses

### Critical Role in Research:
- **Plant Breeding: Identify markers linked to important traits**

- **Ecology: Understand population structure and gene flow**

- **Evolutionary Biology: Study adaptation and speciation**

- **Conservation: Monitor genetic diversity in threatened populations**
